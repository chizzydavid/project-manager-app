# project-manager-app
A web application that lets you add and manage important tasks and projects, keeping track of your progress over time.
Built using jQuery on the front end and PHP on the backend. You can add and manage activities in each project. After an activity belonging to a particular project is checked, the progress for that project is updated and sent to the database.
It also has a 'todo-like' feature that lets you add activities for a particular day and optionally add any of them to an already existing project.
