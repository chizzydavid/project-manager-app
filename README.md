# project-manager-app
A web application that lets you add and manage important tasks and projects, keeping track of your progress over time.
Built using jQuery on the front end and PHP on the backend. You can create new projects in the application and add, edit and delete activities in each project. When each activity belonging to a particular project is checked, the progress for that project is updated and sent to the database.
There is also a todo-like feature where you can add activities for a particular day and add any of those activities to an already existing project.
